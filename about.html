<h2><i>Context</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Every conscience has its own experience of the present. What defines it? Is it in contrast to the previous decade? Is it a reflection in the aftermath of a pandemic? Or is it just human, conscious evolution? In this new technological environment we face a new and distinct era of art, the rise of the internet has given artists the tools for more creative ways to bring their vision to life. 

  Taking inspiration from Aby Warburg’s Mnemosyne Atlas, a class of Art and Multimedia Communication from the Master in Multimedia at the University of Porto composed this deck of Tarot cards showing a glimpse of different views into contemporaneity. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2><i>Purpose</i></h2>
  <br>
<p>During the first semester of the Master in Multimedia at University of Porto, the students with the professor made visual representations of our vision of the present in contrast to the past. We described this exercise as a visual representation of the future, through the Tarot.
  This contextual thinking method can help to develop the ability to analyze and interpret socio-cultural changes and phenomena in various contexts. 
  Dealing with randomness and finding a meaning within it can provide an interesting thought experiment, which is why the form of a Tarot deck was chosen. No matter the card you pull, it’s always possible to relate it to yourself and the world around you.
  The creation of this project in itself also had a plethora of pedagogical purposes:
  <li>Providing intuitive readings of the present times</li>
  <li>Inspiring multiple ways of perceiving current media, particularly in connection with past media and processes</li>  
  <li>Inspiring unorthodox processes of creativity using available digital tools</li> 
  <li>Revealing poetic elements within objective discourse</li> 
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2><i>Processes</i></h2>
  <br>
  Visual collages were associated with meanings of the major arcana, and accompanied by observable poems created by employing Burroughs and Gysin’s Cut Up techniques; Corresponding oral renditions of these poems were recorded and used as source material for audio collages, paralleling the previous visual components.
  <ol>
    <li>At first each student had the task of selecting or producing two images that could represent different aspects of 2021. One image represented contemporaneity in a public level and the other represented contemporaneity in a personal level. The chosen images were made available to all participants on a collective archive.
    </li><br>
    <li>Following Warburg’s approach of compiling like-minded images, each student reassembled all the images they received from their peers. Starting from these images, they worked to match the taxonomy.
    </li><br>
    <li>After thematic identification and compiling of images around these themes, each student produced a composition that connected the images and presented them as a fixed structure: in dynamics of scale, symmetry, contrast, color, etc.
    </li><br>
    <li>Each participant produced a short text to describe and/or interpret their respective visual composition. 
    </li><br>
    <li>After selecting a text from the group or using their own text written in the previous step of the exercise, each student subjected it to the Cut Up method, producing a poetic reimagination of the more literal texts. Only one text was used in each exercise. 
    </li><br>
    <li>Each student was invited to choose one of the "cut-up" texts from one of the classmates, proceeding to make an editorial revision of it - that is, curating the contents to expressively fulfill their poetic dimension. From this new version, the students recorded one or more declamations of the text, exploring different modes of vocal expression.
    </li><br>
    <li>For the final output the participants had to match their collage to a Tarot card of the major arcana. After that they gathered parts of the other participants' poems that would represent their Tarot card best. In that way they created a new poem with parts from all the other participants. They recorded an audio of their poem and also, they recorded it in another way by adding audio to strengthen their message. To finish it off, the visual collage and the final written poem itself was displayed as a card. 
    </li>
</ol>
